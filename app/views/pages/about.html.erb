    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My journey in technology, which began in 2020 and solidified in 2024 with web development, culminated in 2025 with a passion for Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Since then, I've worked as a Fullstack Developer, building scalable and efficient web solutions that aim to positively impact people's lives.</p>

    <p>I'm driven by the ability to transform ideas into functional applications, with an unwavering commitment to excellence and a keen eye for clean code and good architecture. I have hands-on experience developing clean, well-designed Ruby on Rails applications using PostgreSQL and SQLite3 for data management. I'm proficient in front-end development with JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, and modern tools like Hotwire (Turbo and Stimulus.js) and Sass/SCSS.</p>

    <p>My expertise extends to deploying and managing applications in Linux (Ubuntu) production environments. I have proven skills in configuring web (Nginx) and application (Puma) servers, implementing HTTPS with Certbot/Let's Encrypt, managing dependencies with rbenv and Bundler, and configuring services with Systemd. I highlight my strong debugging and troubleshooting capabilities for complex infrastructure and connectivity issues (including 502 Bad Gateway, HTTPS redirect loops, and socket/port access).</p>

    <p>In my day-to-day work, I apply Git best practices for version control, work with the Agile (Scrum) methodology, and am experienced in system debugging. My development environment includes WSL2/Ubuntu and VS Code. I'm a fast learner with excellent communication skills, open to feedback, and strong organizational and project management skills.</p>
